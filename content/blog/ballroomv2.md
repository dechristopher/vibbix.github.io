For the past few weeks, I have been revitalizing my old Playpen Ballroom calculator. The apps objective was to help users find out just how 
many playpen balls could fit inside their room. While I still have a few minor kinks to work out, the Alpha is now available for download.
To join the test you can either [become a tester on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.vibbix.ballroom) or get the code 
off of [Github](https://github.com/vibbix/BallroomCalculator/) and compile it yourself. Feedback and pull requests are always welcome!
