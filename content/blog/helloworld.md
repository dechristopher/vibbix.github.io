Hello world! This is my new blog. It's still a work-in-progress. There are a ton of changes I have to make to the 
theme, including fixing that nasty flexbox categories/tags misalignment in the CSS, tidying up the projects page,
and documenting my work. I'm going to try to keep the site updated often. I also have a custom theme in the works thats
much more ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ.
