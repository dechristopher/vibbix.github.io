      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks, I have been revitalizing my old Playpen Ballroom calculator. The apps objective was to help users find out just how
many playpen balls could fit inside their room. While I still have a few minor kinks to work out, the Alpha is now available for download.
To join the test you can either &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.vibbix.ballroom&#34;&gt;become a tester on the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt; or get the code
off of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vibbix/BallroomCalculator/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and compile it yourself. Feedback and pull requests are always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
